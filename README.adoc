= login-filter: Filter-based Login mechanism

This is a skeleton of a Java EE Filter-based Login mechanism that I intially
wrote in 2006 to compare with a Struts-based login.

To keep the code focused on its topic, there is no database checking so the login name and
password are hardcoded; in short, it is just the bare essentials 
needed to demonstrate this type of login mechanism.

You can use this for anything with credit and without fee.

For a more comprehensive implementation of this idea (unrelated to my
implementation), look  for a project called "securityfilter" (which is currently at
http://securityfilter.sourceforge.net/).

== ToDo

. Use request.login() to obviate the need for the LoginFilterHTTPServletRequest.java
. The redirect path is hard-coded to /login.jsp;
if deployed in a sub-directory webapp (e.g., not at the root of a virtual host),
it redirects to this page, which of course either fails or goes to the wrong page.
