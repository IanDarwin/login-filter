Servlet-Filter-based Login mechanism

This is a skeleton of a Filter-based Login mechanism that I wrote to compare
with a Struts-based login.

It is necessarily incomplete (there is no database checking so the login name and
password are hardcoded); in short, it has been cut down to just the bare essentials 
needed to demonstrate this type of login mechanism.

You can use this for anything without fee.

For a full implementation of this (unrelated to my
implementation), look  for a project called 
"securityfilter" (which is currently at
http://securityfilter.sourceforge.net/).
